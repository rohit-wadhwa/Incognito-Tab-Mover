Incognito Tab Mover is a Chrome extension designed to bridge the gap between privacy and productivity. It allows users to seamlessly transfer tabs from an incognito window to the main browser window with a simple keystroke (ALT+M on Windows/Linux, Option+M on Mac), ensuring that URLs are moved without transferring any session history.

## Features

- **Easy Transfer**: Move tabs from incognito to a regular window using a keyboard shortcut.
- **Privacy First**: Transfers only the URL, not the session history, maintaining your privacy.
- **User Convenience**: Eliminates the need to bookmark or manually copy URLs from incognito sessions.

## Limitations

- Currently, the extension does not support moving all tabs at once from incognito to the main browser. Each tab needs to be moved individually.
- Each tab opened via the extension will open in a separate new window. Users may need to manually organize these tabs into their desired existing window.

## Installation
